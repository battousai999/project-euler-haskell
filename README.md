# project-euler-haskell

This project contains my implementations of the [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) problems in the programming language [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/) (which I started in an effort to increase my familiarity with Haskell).

Project Euler is an ever-expanding collection of computational, largely mathematical programming problems that vary in difficulty from relatively easy to very difficult.
